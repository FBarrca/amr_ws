Full speed forward and slow at corners
Do not use very aggresive mandos as to avoid slipping (acceleration)

Resample only each x samples to make it faster (10 now but might be better to make it more)

Particle reduction technique -> number of clusters or KLD sampling

Intersection in localization POMDP to choose the direction to look at 

Vectorizing with numpy or C++

Rotate at the start at localization right after localized.
